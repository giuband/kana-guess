## kana-guess

A fun project I developed to help myself (and possibly others!) remember kana. This project was born because I believe that an app rooted on positive reinforcement – by tracking your errors and adapting its behavior to ask those questions more frequently – is key to memorize all these symbols with as little confusion as possible.

## Contributing

I am not planning major changes to this game for now; if you'd like to see new features implemented please open an issue or even better, a PR with the proposed changes.
